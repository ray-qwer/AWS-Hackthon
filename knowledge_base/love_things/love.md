# I. Attachment Theory

## 1. Origins of Attachment Theory: Bowlby's Theoretical Foundation

Attachment theory was first proposed by British psychologist John Bowlby, who believed that attachment is an innate behavioral system with evolutionary significance. This system drives infants to form emotional bonds with their primary caregivers to ensure protection and care in the face of danger or uncertainty. Bowlby emphasized that such "attachment relationships" are not limited to childhood but profoundly influence an individual's lifelong trust and intimacy in interpersonal relationships.

Bowlby highlighted that when an individual experiences stress or need, if the attachment figure demonstrates three key qualities—availability, sensitivity, and supportiveness—it fosters a sense of security and trust. Additionally, he introduced the concept of internal working models, which suggests that individuals form beliefs and expectations about themselves and others based on early attachment experiences. These internal models shape subsequent emotional interactions and social behaviors.

## 2. Infant Attachment Styles: Mary Ainsworth's Empirical Research

Mary Ainsworth was a key figure in empirically testing attachment theory. She developed the Strange Situation Test, which observed infants' behavioral responses when separated and reunited with their mothers. This led to the classification of three main attachment styles:

- **Secure Attachment:** The infant uses the mother as a "secure base" to explore the environment. The child becomes distressed when the mother leaves but is easily comforted upon her return.

- **Anxious-Ambivalent Attachment:** The infant exhibits anxiety even when the mother is present, becomes highly distressed upon her departure, and shows conflicting behaviors—desiring contact but also resisting comfort—upon her return.

- **Avoidant Attachment:** The infant shows indifference to the mother's presence or absence, appearing emotionally distant or indifferent during both separation and reunion.

Subsequent research added a fourth category:

- **Disorganized Attachment:** These infants display inconsistent or fearful responses, often seen in cases involving trauma or neglect. Their behavior lacks a clear attachment strategy.

Statistics show that approximately 70% of infants exhibit secure attachment, 15% anxious-ambivalent, and another 15% avoidant. Disorganized attachment is less common but has more pronounced effects on later development.

## 3. Expansion of Attachment Theory to Adulthood: Contributions by Hazan, Shaver, and Brennan

Attachment theory has been extended beyond infancy. Psychologists Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied the theory to adult romantic relationships, asserting that patterns of interaction in intimate relationships mirror early caregiver attachments. In other words, attachment styles developed in childhood continue to influence how adults regulate emotions, trust others, and manage dependence in relationships.

Further, Kelly Brennan and colleagues proposed a two-dimensional model of adult attachment based on Anxiety and Avoidance, forming four attachment styles:

- **Secure Attachment (Low Anxiety, Low Avoidance):** Individuals are comfortable with intimacy, can depend on others, and allow others to depend on them.  
  *Example:* "Xiao Hua easily gets close to others and feels safe relying on them while also being a dependable figure. She feels secure in relationships."

- **Anxious-Preoccupied Attachment (High Anxiety, Low Avoidance):** These individuals crave closeness, fear abandonment, and require constant reassurance, often becoming overly dependent.  
  *Example:* "Xiao Xun deeply longs for love and closeness but always doubts her self-worth and fears others will leave her, leading to insecurity in relationships."

- **Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment (Low Anxiety, High Avoidance):** Individuals value independence, avoid intimacy, and feel uncomfortable depending on or being depended on by others.

- **Fearful-Avoidant Attachment (High Anxiety, High Avoidance):** These individuals desire closeness but fear rejection or being hurt, leading to internal conflict and emotional struggle.

## 4. Applications and Social Impacts of Attachment Theory

Attachment theory helps explain behavior in romantic relationships, but also extends to individuals' reactions to stress, levels of self-esteem, emotional stability, and ability to form social relationships. People with different attachment styles often cope with stress, conflict, and adversity in vastly different ways, which influences their interpersonal behaviors and mental well-being.

Modern psychology has also applied attachment theory to the field of parasocial interaction. Research shows that individuals with insecure attachment styles (particularly anxious and fearful types) are more likely to seek emotional solace through one-sided emotional bonds with idols, fictional characters, or online influencers when real-world relationships are lacking.

## 5. Plasticity and Development Potential of Attachment Styles

While early attachment experiences significantly impact personality and social behavior, attachment styles are not fixed. Psychological studies show that through positive later-life experiences, therapy, or self-awareness and personal growth, individuals can shift from insecure to more secure attachment styles.

This offers promising opportunities for psychological counseling and interpersonal education, and gives hope to those seeking change and healing from emotional difficulties.

## Summary of Attachment Styles

### 1. Secure Attachment
- **Traits:** Positive beliefs about self and others. Feels worthy of love and trusts others.
- **Source of Security:** Consistent and stable caregiving experiences.

### 2. Dismissive-Avoidant Attachment
- **Traits:** Low anxiety, high avoidance; avoids intimacy, distrusts others, values independence.
- **Example:** "Hao Hao tends to reject intimacy and finds it difficult to trust or rely on others."

### 3. Fearful-Avoidant Attachment
- **Traits:** High anxiety, high avoidance; desires intimacy but fears getting hurt, swinging between approach and withdrawal.
- **Example:** "Ah-De is conflicted about close relationships—he wants intimacy but is afraid of being hurt."

## Formation and Change of Attachment

### 1. Causes of Attachment Formation
Attachment styles are largely shaped by early life experiences, particularly the consistency and sensitivity of caregivers.
- **Anxious Style:** Caused by inconsistent or neglectful caregiving; children act out intensely to gain attention.
- **Avoidant Style:** Caused by long-term unresponsiveness; children suppress emotions and rely solely on themselves.

### 2. Can Attachment Styles Change?
Yes, attachment styles can change due to later-life experiences and social interactions.
Scientific findings (PanSci):
- 96% of securely attached children remain secure into adulthood.
- Only 76% of insecurely attached children remain insecure.
- About 30% of insecure individuals later become securely attached.

# II. Psychology of Love

Love is one of the most common concerns in people's lives. Often, we think love is irrational and illogical. Nevertheless, many psychologists strive to understand why and how this emotion occurs.

## 1. Like vs. Love

### 1.1 Rubin's Love Scale
Many people struggle to distinguish between liking and loving. Psychologists have proposed various theories to explain the differences. Typically, liking leans toward friendship: while there is mutual attraction and willingness to share, there is no strong attachment involved. Rubin believed that liking and loving are different emotions. He identified three components of love:

- **Caring:** Valuing the other person's needs and feelings as much as your own.
- **Attachment:** Wanting to be cared for, recognized, and in close contact with the other.
- **Intimacy:** Sharing feelings and thoughts with each other.

The three components of liking are:
- **Admiration:** Having a positive evaluation of the other.
- **Respect:** Holding the person in high regard.
- **Similarity:** Feeling that the other person is like oneself.

Based on these components, Rubin designed a Love Scale. Want to test your feelings for someone? Answer the following statements based on your own situation:

1. When they feel down, I see it as my important responsibility to cheer them up.
2. I can trust them in all matters.
3. I find it easy to overlook their faults.
4. I would do anything for them.
5. I feel a bit possessive toward them.
6. I feel very unhappy if I can't be with them.
7. When I feel lonely, the first person I want to find is them.
8. I care deeply about their happiness.
9. I'm willing to forgive anything they do.
10. I feel it's my responsibility to ensure their happiness.
11. When I'm with them, I find myself doing nothing but just staring at them.
12. If I could make them trust me 100%, I'd feel very happy.
13. I find life hard to bear without them.
14. When we're together, we often want to do the same things.
15. I think they are a great person.
16. I'd recommend them for something that earns respect from others.
17. In my view, they are particularly mature.
18. I have great confidence in them.
19. I think most people have a good impression of them.
20. I feel they are very similar to me.
21. I would vote for them in any class or group activity.
22. I think they are one of those people who easily earn respect.
23. I believe they are incredibly intelligent.
24. I think they're one of the most likable people I know.
25. They are the kind of person I'd like to learn from.
26. I feel they can easily win others' favor.

**Result Analysis:**  
Items 1–13 reflect the Love Scale, and items 14–26 reflect the Like Scale. Compare how many items you agree with in each group to find out whether your feelings lean more toward liking or loving.

### 1.2 Triangular Theory of Love
Proposed by American psychologist Robert J. Sternberg, this theory states that love consists of three components:

- **Passion:** Rooted mainly in sexual desire and the yearning to be physically close.
- **Intimacy:** Feeling happiness and support when together.
- **Commitment:** A decision to love someone and maintain the relationship.

These three elements combine to form seven types of love:
- Only Intimacy = **Liking**
- Only Commitment = **Empty Love**
- Only Passion = **Infatuation**
- Intimacy + Commitment = **Companionate Love**
- Intimacy + Passion = **Romantic Love**
- Commitment + Passion = **Fatuous Love**
- All three components = **Consummate Love**

Sternberg believed that the larger the triangle, the richer the love. Consummate Love, with all three components, is the ideal form of love—but like perfect competition in economics, it is rare and idealistic.

## 2. Why Are We Attracted to Others?

### 2.1 The Suspension Bridge Effect
When people are in a dangerous situation, their heart rate increases. If someone happens to be nearby, that physical arousal might be misattributed as romantic attraction. This was proposed in 1976 by Canadian psychologists Donald Dutton and Arthur Aron, who conducted several experiments.

**Experiment 1**  
A beautiful female assistant approached three groups of male college students: on a 70-meter high suspension bridge, on a low stone bridge, and in a quiet park. She first asked them to fill out a questionnaire and then create a story based on a picture. After the survey, she gave them her phone number. The group on the suspension bridge had the highest callback rate, and their stories contained more romantic elements.

**Experiment 2**  
The setup was similar: a beautiful woman waited on both the suspension bridge and the low bridge, asking men passing by to participate in a survey and giving them her number. About half of the men from the suspension bridge called her back, while only around 10% from the low bridge did.

This illustrates the Two-Factor Theory of Emotion, which says people try to find a cause for their physiological arousal. In this case, the heart racing could be attributed either to fear from being on a high bridge or to the woman's attractiveness. When uncertain, misattribution of arousal may occur, leading people to believe they've fallen in love.

### 2.2 Mere Exposure Effect
People tend to develop a preference for things merely because they are familiar with them. Psychologist Robert Zajonc tested this by showing participants a yearbook with unfamiliar faces, followed by photos of the same people appearing at varying frequencies. Participants rated those who appeared more often as more likable.

**Limitations:**
- If the first impression is negative, mere exposure has no effect.
- Seeing someone you dislike too often increases aversion.
- Too frequent or prolonged exposure may lead to reverse effects.

The Mere Exposure Effect works best with short, frequent exposures—ideally 10 to 20 times. However, initial impressions play a significant role. If the first impression is bad, repeated exposure may actually reinforce negative feelings.

## 3. Physiological Reactions in Love

### 1. Brain Activity
Anthropologist Helen Fisher conducted a study involving 32 participants—17 were in a state of passionate love, and 15 had recently been rejected (heartbroken). She performed MRI brain scans on all participants. During the scan, they were shown photos of their lovers, interspersed with distraction tasks, to observe differences in brain activity during high engagement and rest.

She discovered that in the 17 people in love, a small region in the brain was activated—the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The VTA is part of the brain's reward system, located deep in the brain, and is associated with desire, motivation, focus, and craving. This region contains cells that produce dopamine, which is transmitted to many other brain regions. Interestingly, this same area is also activated when people experience cocaine addiction. This explains why people in love often feel obsessive, lose themselves, and intensely crave being with the other person.

For the 15 heartbroken individuals, three brain regions showed activity. Surprisingly, one of them was also the VTA, suggesting that even after a breakup, people do not simply give up but may fall even deeper into longing. This reward system becomes even more active when desires are unmet, driving people to do everything possible to attain what they want.

The second brain region is involved in calculating gains and losses. Heartbroken individuals often uncontrollably ruminate over what they did wrong, what they lost, and what they gained. This region is also activated when we take big risks in pursuit of great rewards or when facing major losses.

The third region is associated with deep attachment to others. Even after being rejected, people may still feel deeply attached to their former partners. This brain system fuels persistent efforts and focus to regain what was lost.

Fisher concluded that love is an instinctive need. Unlike sexual desire, love allows us to focus on one person. It shares many characteristics with addiction—we obsessively think about the person, constantly seek closeness, and even if we think we've moved on, emotions can suddenly resurface like a relapse.

However, love alone isn't enough to sustain a relationship. Once the initial passion fades, the secretion of chemicals like cortisol and testosterone returns to normal. At this stage, the cerebral cortex becomes involved, critically evaluating whether this person is a suitable partner for reproduction and long-term companionship.

Here are some substances related to love:

- **Dopamine:**  
  A neurotransmitter that creates feelings of pleasure and excitement. It's used medically to treat depression. Dopamine fuels desire and motivation, making people pursue goals passionately. In love, the brain releases large amounts of dopamine. Similarly, drugs also boost dopamine, showing how addictive its effects can be. However, excessive dopamine can lead to hyperactivity or even schizophrenia.

- **Testosterone:**  
  A steroid hormone mainly secreted by the testes, with smaller amounts from the ovaries and adrenal glands. It's the primary male sex hormone, enhancing physical strength, libido, and bone density, and driving secondary sexual traits. Interestingly, during love, adrenal stimulation increases testosterone in women but decreases it in men (this finding applies to heterosexual individuals; it's unclear if it applies to other orientations).

- **Serotonin:**  
  An inhibitory neurotransmitter that influences mood, libido, learning, memory, and more. It helps calm heightened emotions. Dysfunction in serotonin is believed to contribute to depression. Animal studies show increasing serotonin reduces aggression. In love, cortisol levels rise, which reduces serotonin, making lovers more irritable and prone to obsessive behavior.

- **Oxytocin:**  
  Secreted by the hypothalamus, it aids uterine contractions during childbirth and stimulates breast milk production. It's known as the "cuddle hormone" and promotes bonding between mother and child. It helps stabilize emotions, reduce anxiety, increase trust, and relieve pain and stress. Psychologist Ruth Feldman found that people in love produce twice as much oxytocin as pregnant women. It enhances empathy, communication, and reduces the likelihood of infidelity, playing a key role in relationship maintenance.

- **Cortisol:**  
  Also known as the "stress hormone", secreted by the adrenal glands, it increases blood pressure, blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system to help cope with stress. When people fall in love, cortisol levels rise, which in turn affects testosterone. As the relationship stabilizes, cortisol decreases—and the more secure and intimate the relationship, the lower the cortisol levels.

### 2. Broken Heart Syndrome
Many describe breakups as feeling like being stabbed in the heart. This may not be mere exaggeration—it could actually be Broken Heart Syndrome.

The official name is stress-induced cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, first identified by a Japanese cardiologist. During an episode, the left ventricle of the heart balloons out into a shape resembling a Japanese octopus trap. Sudden emotional trauma or shock can trigger symptoms similar to a heart attack, even in healthy individuals.

The left ventricle contracts abnormally, and women are more prone to this condition, though the reasons remain unclear. Some believe it's related to men having more adrenaline receptors in their heart cells than women, meaning men may be better equipped to handle stress.

During periods of emotional distress, the secretion of adrenaline and noradrenaline—both stress hormones—increases dramatically. In patients with broken heart syndrome, these hormone levels can be 7 to 34 times higher than in those with myocardial infarction. Excessive stress hormones can be toxic to the heart, causing damage.

Fortunately, this condition is rare and reversible—once emotions stabilize, heart function returns to normal, and recurrence is unlikely.

## 4. Conclusion
The above theories and experiments help us gain a deeper understanding of the nature of love. Due to space constraints, the introduction stops here, but in reality, the subject of love remains an ongoing area of research and discovery.
